Implement folder checking:
- Config.properties for local storage locations for each comic's folder.
- Code to check where the archiver left off last time and return either the last downloaded URL or the next target.
-- That can be fed into the get_next loop.

Factory pattern:
- Build an archiver for a second webcomic.
- Build a factory that can run both archivers.  This will be the engine core.

Code quality:
- Frequent linting (comes under language training as well).
- Error handling choke points
-- Web fetches
-- File read/writes
- Replace the console output with actual logs.
-- Probably should have each archiver run a separate log file.
- Any reasonable optimization?

Longer term:
- Multithread the archivers so I can be updating n archives simultaneously?
-- What size do I want n to be?
-- Error handling: an error needs to kill one archiver with good error messages,
    but not kill the entire multitask structure.
